# Simplamo Updates v1.20

## 📢 What's News?
In version 3 of the Rock feature, the system allows users to link targets at different levels and automatically calculate the progress value of those targets. This brings many benefits to users, optimizing their experience and saving time in the target breakdown process.

The feature of linking targets between levels also helps users to track the progress of targets in a more detailed and easier way. They can view the progress of each sub-target and parent target at the same time on a dashboard. This helps users make target management decisions more accurately and efficiently.
